I use a a lightweight suite of tools and experiments designed to prototype and evaluate generative AI systems using open-source LLMs. This repo explores applied natural language processing techniques with a focus on:

- Instruction tuning
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Fine-tuning workflows (LoRA, QLoRA, DeepSpeed)
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Prompt engineering for downstream tasks (chatbots, classification, generation)

## üîç What's Inside

- `notebooks/`: Hands-on experiments with LLM inference, tokenization, and RAG pipelines.
- `prompt-engineering/`: Chains and splitter examples for zero-shot and few-shot tasks.
- `finetune/`: Starter configs for LoRA and DeepSpeed fine-tuning strategies.
- `multi-agent/`: Orchestration patterns for collaborative agents and task routing.
- `rag/`: Retrieval pipelines using open-source embedding models and vector DBs.

## üß† Key Concepts

This repo serves as a sandbox for exploring:

- Instruction vs Classification fine-tuning
- In-Context Learning & Chain of Thought prompting
- Parameter-efficient training methods (PEFT)
- Open-source vs proprietary LLM trade-offs
- Integration of LLMs with traditional ML and enterprise APIs

## üí° Why This Matters

LLMs are evolving rapidly. This repo helps practitioners and developers:

- Prototype and deploy lean NLP systems
- Understand trade-offs in architecture and cost
- Evaluate open vs closed model capabilities
- Build grounded solutions for real-world scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Frameworks

- PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain, FAISS, Chroma
- Google Colab, DeepSpeed, PEFT, LoRA

## üìÇ Example Use Cases

- Building agentic chatbots for customer service
- Automating classification tasks with few-shot prompts
- Connecting LLMs with structured databases
- Designing scalable fine-tuning pipelines
