# LLM OPS
I use a a lightweight suite of tools and experiments designed to prototype and evaluate generative AI systems using open-source LLMs. This repo explores applied natural language processing techniques with a focus on:

- Instruction tuning
- RAG
- Fine-tuning workflows
- Multi-agent cooperation
- Prompt engineering

## Key Concepts

This repo serves for exploring:

- Instruction vs Classification fine-tuning
- In-Context Learning & Chain of Thought prompting
- Parameter-efficient training methods (PEFT)
- Open-source vs proprietary LLM trade-offs
- Integration of LLMs with traditional ML and enterprise APIs

## Why This Matters

LLMs are evolving rapidly. This repo helps:

- Prototype and deploy lean NLP systems
- Understand trade-offs in architecture and cost
- Evaluate open vs closed model capabilities
- Build grounded solutions for real-world scenarios

## Tools & Frameworks

- PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain, FAISS, Chroma
- Google Colab, DeepSpeed, PEFT, LoRA
